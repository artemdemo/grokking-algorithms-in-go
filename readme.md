# Some basic algorithms written in Go

Just playing around with Go, while reading "Grokking algorithms" by Aditya Y. Bhargava

## How to start

1. Install Go on your machine
1. Run `./test.sh`

## Tests

* `./test.sh` - run with terminal only output
* `./test.sh --html` - get detailed output of covered lines
